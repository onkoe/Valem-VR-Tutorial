## Usage
For best results, please ensure that you're using a Unity version around 2019.4. This will guarantee the success of the XR plugin's inputs working correctly. 

## Copyright
Valem has provided this code as open source and free for use within any of your projects. Following the YouTube tutorials would result in the same code.
